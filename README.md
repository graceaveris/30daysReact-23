**Day Twenty Three - 30 days of React challenge - "Post-it note" V2 (refractored & deployed)**

Refractored and deployed version of my last app in this series : a todo list style react.js app, using post it notes interface. Full crud functionality, create + update + delete.

Try it yourself: https://react-postit-notes.herokuapp.com/

**Concepts Explored:**

- Refractoring to create DRY code.
- Deploying a React app with Heroku.

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
