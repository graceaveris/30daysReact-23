A refractored and deployed version of my last app in this series : a todo list style react.js app, using post it notes interface.

**Concepts Explored:**

- Deploying a React app with Heroku.

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
